Changelog...

v2
X11rdp-o-Matic
-------------------------
. Added package repository update before checking for required packages
. Modularized for multiple dialog front-ends
. Added a text dialog front-end
. Added a check for running on a non-X display terminal (will revert to text-only if so)
. Uses the text mode front-end by default - Zenity is limited and rubbish!
. Added command line parameters: --justdoit , --nocpuoptimze , --zenityfrontend , --keepsource , --nocleanup
. Now runs in a text only environment - suitable for "Server" distro variants with no Xorg installed as yet, or
  basically for anyone who prefers the text interface over the Zenity one.
. Added a non-interactive, "just do it" mode so script will run from start to end, with "sane" defaults
. Really tidied up the script, should make it easier to read and edit later
. Source code is downloaded to inside wherever the ScaryMatic directory is located
. Added alteration of xrdp source code Makefile.am so the PID file is now in /var/run/xrdp/
. Changed "PIDDIR=/var/run/" to "PIDDIR=/var/run/xrdp/" in the xrdp init script
