Brief Instructions
------------------

1) The two files you need to run are x11rdp-o-matic.sh , and RDPsesconfig.sh

2) x11rdp-o-matic.sh will compile, install, and set up X11rdp and xrdp on your system.

3) RDPsesconfig.sh will configure the .xsession file for each selected user on your system and
	with whatever desktop environment you've chosen for them.

4) Both utilities need to be run as root, so use su to get to your root prompt, or use sudo to start them

5) Relax as the utilities walk you through the process of both getting RDP installed, and configuring your RDP user's sessions ;)

6) Please consider a donation if you found this useful :)
